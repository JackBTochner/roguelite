<p>The hub scene acts as the vehicle for the main narrative, whilst the combat acts as the main gameplay pull. </p>
<h3 id="micro-gameplay-loops">Micro Gameplay Loops</h3>
<h4 id="roguelite-gameplay-overview">Roguelite Gameplay Overview</h4>
<p>Kit has nine abilties corespondent to her nine-tails. As Kit is a fox, she has the abilities to dig into the ground where dirt is present to avoid enemies and act as a invulnerable ability.</p>
<p>There will be various enemies within the game with unique abilities and movesets. The main form of enemies are known as wisps. Enemies will drop items that can be brought back to the shop and used as equipment and ingredients for the pens. For example, blue enemies will drop blue pigments that can be used for blue ink. Kit will also have to battle the final boss who has an upgraded moveset and power level compared to other and previous enemies.</p>
<p>After each level is completed, random drops will occur. This can include Modulars, fish and power-ups. Fish can be used to exchange goods with Hebert the bear, who is a lonely shop keeper. Herbert randomly spawns in between levels and has a small stall where goods can be exchanged given the player has enough fish. Power-ups can also randomly drop which powers up Kit&#39;s abilties and movesets.</p>
<p>The levels are all randomly generated based on locations of Melbourne. There is no set order that the level come and go. As the levels are based on Melbourne locations, the traps are also fixated on distinguishable Melbourne attributes such as tram traps. Trams go pass in levels that are applicable and can collide with Kit and the enemies. Collison will result in being damaged and stunned as well as pushed.</p>
<h4 id="hubstorefront-gameplay-overview">Hub/Storefront Gameplay Overview</h4>
<p>The gameplay during this time will mainly revolve around making stationary for the customers based on their preferences.</p>
<p>This includes using various components of a pen such as pigment colour, body build and thin/thickness to create the pencil of the customer&#39;s desires.</p>
<p>Players also interact with the customer learning around their own stories as the game progresses. The relationship and story you build with the customer may be affected by your choices as well as fulfilling their needs.<br>Building a strong relationship with the customer can benefit the player&#39;s combat and stats at night. </p>
<p>Customers will pay with the in-game world currency known as Modulars. Modular coins can be used to upgrade the shop game-play wise or simply its appearance.</p>
<h3 id="systems">Systems</h3>
<p>(TODO: link to and write manual pages)</p>
<h4 id="scene-loading">Scene Loading</h4>
<h4 id="narrative-system">Narrative System</h4>
<h4 id="storefront-gameplay">Storefront Gameplay</h4>
<h4 id="map-generation-system">Map Generation System</h4>
<h4 id="combat-system">Combat System</h4>
<p>Combat will be majoritly based on shooting projectiles at enemies, but you will also have a melee ability at your disposal. As the game progresses, you will unlock a total of 8 different projectiles. Each weapon represents a tail of the Kitsune, and will do the following:</p>
<pre><code>Regular tail: Melee weapon.
Lightning Chain: Hits multiple enemies for chain damage (lock on).
Fire: Inflicts burn damage.
Ice: Slows enemies.
Earthquake: Inflicts impact damage on enemies in a straight line.
Poison: Reduces enemies total health by a percentage.
Piercing: Can hit multiple enemies (aimed).
Boomerang: Will inflict damage on initial release and when received.
Cupids Arrow: Will link enemy that&#39;s hit with the next closest enemy, any damage done to one will be inflicted on the other.
</code></pre><p>When attacking an enemy for the first time upon entering a room, you will attach your cast to the enemy you hit. Your cast will increase damage inflicted on that enemy, and your cast will be dropped once the enemy is defeated. You can regain your cast by picking it up after the enemy you affected is defeated or by entering the next room. You may not change the enemy that your cast is on until it is defeated.</p>
<h4 id="perkability-system">Perk/Ability System</h4>
<p>As you progress through the game and create bonds with the NPCs, you will gain passive perks and abilities. Each NPC will be able to give you a passive perk that you will keep throughout the game and will stack with other passive perks you may receive from other NPCs. When you complete a relationship with an NPC, you will receive an ultimate ability. You may unlock multiple ultimates, but you may only equip one at a time. These abilities and perks will be active in every run, and will stay with you when you die. </p>
<h4 id="pen-building-system">Pen-Building system</h4>
<p>Player must walk to their workbench and interact with it. It will open the pen-build UI. It will have a
work bench and tools. Tools include drill, hammer, saw, clips, and water. The drill can be used to
shape the pen body for plastic and aluminium. For wooden pens, a saw must be used. The pen ink
can be made from pigments simply by applying water. For the tip of the pen, clips must be used for
the materials. To assembly a full pen with all the right materials, a hammer must be used.
For the actual game play, players can drag the materials needed onto the work bench. They can then
leave the material on the work bench and drag the tool needs over the material which will
automatically apply the “building” animation resulting in the finished product. E.g, if the player wanted to make a blue plastic felt tip pen, they would need to drag the blue
pigment onto the work bench along with water on the work bench to make the ink. They will then
need to drag the plastic onto the work bench as well and drag the drill to make the body. Then they
will do the same with feathers and clippers. After all the materials are made, if they left all the made
materials on the work bench, then all they need to do to overlap the materials and drag the hammer
to make the pen. Double click on items to obtain them. </p>
<h3 id="currency-systen">Currency systen</h3>
<h4 id="modular">Modular</h4>
<p>The world currency that customers use to pay for their goods. Modular can also be used to
upgrade the hub (shop). The shop can be upgraded with aesthetic changes (e.g different coloured
wallpaper and flooring). The shop can also be upgraded so that the pen making game play can be
made easier.</p>
<p>Obtainability:</p>
<p>• Making correct items for customers (some customers will pay anyways depending on the
customer and your relationship with them)</p>
<p>• Herbert the bear</p>
<p>• Completing levels</p>
<h4 id="fish">Fish</h4>
<p>Fish can be used for Herbert the bear to purchase his shop items. He has a variety stall of items
including Modulars, Power-ups (boons) and enemy drops.</p>
<p>Obtainability:</p>
<p>• Destroying crates that are spawned around the world.</p>
<p>• Completing a level around the Yarra will have a 40% chance of dropping fish at the end of it.</p>
<h4 id="enemy-drops">Enemy drops</h4>
<p>Colour Pigments: Blue, black, green, yellow, purple, red, pink.</p>
<p>Materials: Plastic, Wood, Aluminium, Feathers, lead.</p>
<h2 id="brand-identity">Brand Identity</h2>
<p>Kitsune Corner is fully designed and produced in the heart of Melbourne. Therefore, the setting of the game is also fully based in a cyberpunk, synthwave futuristic fantasy version of Melbourne Victoria.<br>Unlike other Melbourne based games, Kitsune Corner aims to integrate various Melbourne street culture and location within the game. All the levels in the game will be various locations of the Melbourne CBD including famous iconic spaces such as Federation Square, Southbank Walk and Hozier Lane. There will also be less known locations that are still a symbol of Melbourne such as The Block Arcade.</p>
<p>According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, in 2018 the United States of America accounted for 24% of global cultural creative export. This includes many forms of entertainment like Films, video games, music and other media items. This means that various of these contents display American landmarks and locations. Australia is only known for 6.5% of contribution in the creative and cultural industries in 2019. </p>
<p>The game will also comprise characters from different cultural folklore. Melbourne is a very diverse and multicultural city with a significant population of people from different cultural backgrounds. In fact, almost half of the population in Melbourne are either born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016 Census). Having these different cultural characters will highlight the city&#39;s multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Kitsune Corner aims to impress players with the games take on the cyberpunk aesthetic and its hand drawn 2D illustrations. The game also aims to generate connectivity within Australian players, particularly those who reside in Melbourne and display the identical levels to the locations of Melbourne.</p>
