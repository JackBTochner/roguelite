## Platforms

The game will be built for PC to be played on mouse and keyboard, however the controls are designed to easily map and copy onto a controller for players who prefer a hand held experience. Various succesful rouguelikes have been released and made available on PC and the Nintendo Switch. These include The Binding of Isaac, Hades, Risk of Rain 2, Enter The Gungeon. The controls in the game will be programmed onto mouse and keyboard giving players easy and comfortable ergonomic access to use all available abilities without straining their hands. In a research report done by DFC Intelligence, it is found that approximately 48% of all gaming happens on PC. Releasing this game on PC gives access to a wider player base.

## Machinery

What are the mechanics, rules and economies youâ€™re basing your project around? What are the larger meta-structures?
Comprehensively detail these core mechanics and features of your game individually (separate the Power Pellets, Ghosts and Cherries!), and cross link them to one another. 
Present as a clearly and consistently formatted combination of images, diagrams and text.
Sometimes a diagram or flowchart can more quickly communicate mechanical ideas than words alone. Consider also using Finite State Machines (FSMs) in these cases.
Link these pages to and from relevant Trello cards in your team's board, so that team members working on tasks can refer easily to the documentation.

Players will play as a Kitsune known as Kit who is human-like during the day time and a fully transformed nine-tailed fox at night who goes out to hunt. During the day, players run a pen shop where NPC customers arrive to purchase writing goods. The gameplay during this time will be mainly revolved around making pens for the customers based on their preferences. This includes using various components of a pen such as ink colour, body build and thin/thickness to create the pen of the customers desires. Players also interact with the customer learning around their own stories as the game progresses. The relationship and story you build with the customer may be affected by your choices as well as fufilling their needs. Building a strong relationship with the customer can benefit the players combat and stats at night. Customers will pay with the in-game world currency known as Modulars. Modular coins can be used to upgrade the shop game-play wise or simply it's appearance. To activate night-time, players can close their shop to time-skip to night which generates the rouguelike gameplay.

## Brand Identity

Kitsune Corner is fully designed and produced in the heart of Melbounre. Therefore, the setting of the game is also fully based in a cyberpunk, synthwave futureistic fantasy version of Melbourne Victoria. Unlike other Melbourne based games, Kitsune Corner aims to intergrate various Melbourne street culture and location within the game. All the levels in the game will be various locations of the Melbourne CBD including famous iconic spaces such as Federation Square, Southbank Walk and Hozier Lane. There will also be less known locations that are still a symbol of Melbourne such as The Block Arcade. According to the UNESCO Institude for Statistics, in 2018 the United States of America accounted for 24% of global cultural creative export. This includes many forms entertainment like Films, video games, music and other media items. This means that various of these contents display American landmarks and locations. Australia is only known for 6.5% of contribution in the creative and cultural industries in 2019. 
The game will also comprise of characters from different cultural folklore. Melbourne is a very diverse and multicultral city with a significant population of people from different cultural background. In fact, almost half of the population in Melbourne are either born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016 Cenus). Having these different cultural characters will highlight the city's multiculturalism.
Kitsune Corner aims to impress players with the games take on the cyberpunk aesthetic and its hand drawn 2D illustrations. The game also aims to generate connectivity within Australian players, particularly those who reside in Melbourne and display the identical levels to the locations of Melbourne.
