##Platforms
```
What delivery platform do you propose (web, mobile, PC, etc) and why?
Why is your project uniquely suited to this/these platform/s
Research this component and provide a brief, evidence-based argument to support your platform selection
```
Built for PC, playable with standard controller.

##Machinery
```
What are the mechanics, rules and economies youâ€™re basing your project around? What are the larger meta-structures?
Comprehensively detail these core mechanics and features of your game individually (separate the Power Pellets, Ghosts and Cherries!), and cross link them to one another. 
Present as a clearly and consistently formatted combination of images, diagrams and text.
Sometimes a diagram or flowchart can more quickly communicate mechanical ideas than words alone. Consider also using Finite State Machines (FSMs) in these cases.
Link these pages to and from relevant Trello cards in your team's board, so that team members working on tasks can refer easily to the documentation.
```
##Brand Identity
```
What makes your product unique in terms of its branding?
What kinds of concepts and emotions do you aim to associate with the brand?
In this instance the brand is simultaneously the game, the developer and the publisher, who all may convey very particular characteristics that you wish to leverage.
Present an overview of your target demographic
Substantiate your claim with reference to government, industry or academically-sourced statistics.
```
##Schedule
