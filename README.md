## Platforms

The game will be built for PC to be played on mouse and keyboard, however the controls are designed to easily map and copy onto a controller for players who prefer a hand held experience. Various succesful rouguelikes have been released and made available on PC and the Nintendo Switch. These include The Binding of Isaac, Hades, Risk of Rain 2, Enter The Gungeon. The controls in the game will be programmed onto mouse and keyboard giving players easy and comfortable ergonomic access to use all available abilities without straining their hands. In a research report done by DFC Intelligence, it is found that approximately 48% of all gaming happens on PC. Releasing this game on PC gives access to a wider player base.

## Machinery

What are the mechanics, rules and economies youâ€™re basing your project around? What are the larger meta-structures?
Comprehensively detail these core mechanics and features of your game individually (separate the Power Pellets, Ghosts and Cherries!), and cross link them to one another. 
Present as a clearly and consistently formatted combination of images, diagrams and text.
Sometimes a diagram or flowchart can more quickly communicate mechanical ideas than words alone. Consider also using Finite State Machines (FSMs) in these cases.
Link these pages to and from relevant Trello cards in your team's board, so that team members working on tasks can refer easily to the documentation.

## Brand Identity

What makes your product unique in terms of its branding?
What kinds of concepts and emotions do you aim to associate with the brand?
In this instance the brand is simultaneously the game, the developer and the publisher, who all may convey very particular characteristics that you wish to leverage.
Present an overview of your target demographic
Substantiate your claim with reference to government, industry or academically-sourced statistics.
